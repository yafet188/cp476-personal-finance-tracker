## Milestone 02 Summary
During Milestone 02, our team transitioned from planning to implementation. We completed the following:

### Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Built multiple working pages: Dashboard, Expenses, Budgets, Categories, Reports, Login, and Settings.
- Implemented client-side form validation.
- Used DOM manipulation and event handling to dynamically render data.
- Integrated localStorage/sessionStorage for temporary frontend data persistence.
- Connected pages through consistent navigation and user session handling.

### Backend (Node.js)
- Implemented server structure and routing.
- Created API endpoints for handling core data (expenses, budgets, etc.).
- Structured project for scalable server-side logic.

### Database (MySQL)
- Designed relational schema for users, expenses, categories, and budgets.
- Defined core entities and relationships.
- Prepared database structure to integrate with backend APIs.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Run the Frontend

If using Live Server (recommended for development):

```bash
cd frontend
```

Open `dashboard.html` or `login.html` using VSCode Live Server.

OR open directly in browser:

```bash
open dashboard.html
```

Frontend typically runs on:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```

### 2️⃣ Database Setup

MySQL is required, the schema must be initialized before starting the server.

**1. Initialize Schema**
- Open `src/database/schema.sql` in your MySQL client.
- Execute the entire script to create the `finance_tracker` database, tables, and default categories.

**2. Configure Environment**
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory.
- Update the credentials in `.env` to match your local setup:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=finance_tracker
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3000
```

---

### ️3️⃣ Run the Backend

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Backend runs on:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Make sure MySQL is running before starting the backend.

## Current Project Status
Milestone 02 – Functional frontend interface + backend server structure + database schema design completed.

Next steps will include full integration between frontend, backend, and database.
